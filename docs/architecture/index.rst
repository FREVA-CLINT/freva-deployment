**Freva's Architecture:** In this section, delves into the
core components that constitute the architecture of Freva.
Understanding the architecture lays the groundwork for effective
configuration and administration of Freva.

**Configuring Freva Core Library:** The Freva core library forms the
backbone of the system, housing essential functionalities and modules. This
section guides you through the configuration of the core library, including
setting up service connections, defining data processing plugins
configuring the workload manager. By following these configuration
guidelines, you can tailor the core library to meet your specific
requirements and ensure seamless integration with other components of Freva.

**Exploring Directory Structure:**
Understanding the directory structure of Freva is essential for efficient
organization and management of data and resources. Here, we navigate
through the directory structure of Freva, explaining the purpose and
contents of each directory. Freva utilizes Directory
Reference Syntax (DRS) for configuring metadata within the directory
structure. DRS allows administrators to define metadata attributes for
datasets, facilitating enhanced search capabilities within the data
browser service that is used to quickly search millions of datasets.
We provide guidance on configuring DRS, including specifying
metadata attributes and integrating them into the data browser search
service. By familiarizing yourself with DRS configuration, you can enrich
the metadata associated with datasets and improve discoverability within
Freva's filesystem, empowering users to leverage its resources more
effectively.
