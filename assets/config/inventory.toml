#   - Comments begin with the "#" character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - The groups define different deployment steps
#   - Additional configuration for each group is set in the confg section
#     of each header -> [header.config]
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
